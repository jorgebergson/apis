### Private companies without e-CNPJ
We strongly recommend the use of a digital certificate, with which the online hiring process can be done. For customers who do not have a digital certificate, exceptionally, the request can be made through [this form](https://www.serpro.gov.br/menu/contato/cliente/cliente/@@template_contato). In this process, hiring takes longer, as it follows a manual procedure.

### Public bodies
If you have not yet contacted Serpro, access the [government contract form](https://servicos.serpro.gov.br/governo-contratacao/), 
fill in the data and choose Serpro API. At the end of the registration, our service team receives the request and will appoint a person to contact you. If you already have your Business Consultant at Serpro, simply request the contract.

### Class entities

It follows the same flow of public agencies. Access our [contact form](https://www.serpro.gov.br/menu/contato/cliente/cliente/@@template_contato), fill in the data and choose Serpro API. At the end of the registration, our service team receives the request and will escalate a person to contact

### Economic Groups
When there is more than one CNPJ of the same entity that needs to use the application, instead of making the contract one by one, it is possible to make a global contract, with successive adhesions by the other entities. Access our [service form](https://www.serpro.gov.br/menu/contato/cliente/cliente/@@template_contato) and our service team will contact you.

### How to cancel
The contract can be canceled at any time, by a simple expression of will through our [Call Center](https://atendimento.serpro.gov.br/apicpf).
